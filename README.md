IT1510-Bash Scripting Homework
I’m thinking of a number
Create a bash script that plays the number guessing game.  You know the game where one person things of a number between 1 and 100, then the guesser guesses the number.  The first person then tell the user if the correct answer is higher or lower than their guess.  In our case the person thinking of the number will be a bash script.
Requirements:
•	Create a script name guess.sh
•	The script will choose a random number from 1 to 100 and ask the user to guess the number.
•	The user enters their guess.
•	The script determines if the answer is higher, lower or correct.
•	If the correct answer is higher or lower than the guess inform the user (higher or lower) and let them guess again.
•	Keep track of the number of guesses.
•	If the answer was correct let the user know how many guesses it took to get the correct answer.
•	HINT:  use the bash function  $RANDOM to get a random number, use whatever resources you can find to figure out how to use $RANDOM.
•	I have uploaded a bash quick reference guide to help you with the test conditions.
Deliverable:
Upload your bash script to canvas.  You must upload your script from your Linux virtual machine.  Use the web browser (ApplicationsInternetIceweasel Web Browser) in your VM to go to canvas and upload your script.
